## Description  
Irene Photography Website is a personal portfolio where I share the photos I've taken as part of my passion for photography. The site features a variety of images including animals like dogs and cats, driveways, flowers, paintings, and more. I created this site to display my work and allow others to enjoy the small, beautiful moments I capture through my lens. It’s a simple, visual space that reflects how I see the world through photography.
